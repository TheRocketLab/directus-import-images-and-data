July 2020 was a particularly bad month for cyber security, seeing a 653 percent increase in malicious activity. </p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://news.superloop.com/content/images/2021/06/image-5.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\"><figcaption><em>Deep Instincts Threat Report 2020</em></figcaption></figure><p>The report also noted that the increase was not just a result of an increase in the number of attacks but also in the growth in sophistication of attacks that are making detection particularly challenging. </p><p></p><h2 id=\"malware-explained\"><strong>Malware explained</strong></h2><p>Malware, which is short for malicious software, is any kind of program used to infect, damage, or disrupt the files of a victim’s computer. Generally, malware is malicious code that a cyber criminal develops that either gives them access to the network of an infected computer or that intends to harm or destroy data and files in a network.</p><p>As outlined in <a href=\"https://go.crowdstrike.com/rs/281-OBQ-266/images/Report2021GTR.pdf\">Crowdstrike’s 2021 Global Threat Report</a>, one reason why malware is particularly damaging and so widespread today is because cyber criminals have turned to a ‘malware-as-a-service’ mode of operations to churn out malware and sell to other hackers. Kits are becoming easier and cheaper to obtain, making the overhead of time and money for criminals to enter cyber crime lower than ever before.</p><p></p><h2 id=\"how-does-malware-enter-a-network\"><strong>How does malware enter a network?</strong></h2><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://news.superloop.com/content/images/2021/06/image-6.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\"><figcaption>The biggest risk to network security is you.</figcaption></figure><p>Typically, the biggest threat of a malware attack comes inadvertently from employees. For malware programs to enter an organisation’s system, a person generally needs to perform an action to allow it access. Similar to other forms of cyber criminal activity, the entry points include tricking an individual into clicking on something they shouldn’t, such as an email attachment or hacked web ads, downloading an infected app, and so on. </p><p>Over time, hackers have become increasingly deceptive in the ways that they’re able to convince or trick an individual to click on their malicious software. Frequently malicious actors use <a href=\"https://www.imperva.com/learn/application-security/social-engineering-attack/\">social engineering techniques</a> to exploit human nature and trick people into falling for their tricks and deception. </p><p></p><h2 id=\"what-are-the-different-types-of-malware\"><strong>What are the different types of malware?</strong></h2><p>A malware infection comes in various forms, each of which enters a system in a different entry point and performs different functions. Here are 10 of the most likely malware forms that could infiltrate a company’s computer system. </p><h3 id=\"viruses\"><strong>Viruses</strong></h3><p>Although the media will often refer to all malware as a computer virus, viruses are a particular strain of malware. Although once popular, viruses today represent <a href=\"https://www.csoonline.com/article/2615925/security-your-quick-guide-to-malware-types.html\">less than 10 percent of malware attacks</a>. </p><p>When a virus enters its host computer, it attacks and modifies files or the pointers to those files so that when someone wants to open that file, the virus is also deployed. Among malware, viruses are the only type that infect other files, which, if the COVID-19 pandemic has taught us anything, makes it extremely difficult to eradicate from a network.</p><h3 id=\"trojans\"><strong>Trojans</strong></h3><p>Like the Greek <a href=\"https://www.ox.ac.uk/news/arts-blog/did-trojan-horse-exist-classicist-tests-greek-myths\">myth of the Trojan Horse</a>, Trojan malware masquerades as a legitimate program to convince a user to open the gates to a computer and its network. </p><p>Trojan malware has become <a href=\"https://www.csoonline.com/article/2615925/security-your-quick-guide-to-malware-types.html\">one of the most popular techniques</a> for hackers to gain access to a network. This type of malware also tends to be difficult to defend against because they’re easy for cyber criminals to produce and they rely on the unpredictable actions of individuals to let the Trojan in. </p><h3 id=\"droppers\"><strong>Droppers</strong></h3><p>A dropper is a form of Trojan that, once it’s found its way into a system, installs or ‘drops’ other pieces of malware into the compromised system and then deletes itself once its job is complete. This is why it’s <a href=\"https://resources.infosecinstitute.com/topic/malware-spotlight-droppers/\">often referred to</a> as “the malware that precipitates malware.” As droppers delete themselves after they’ve fulfilled their function, they don’t actually save within the network, but the presence of droppers are usually a precursor to an attack that serves to further the ultimate goal of the attack.   </p><h3 id=\"worms\"><strong>Worms</strong></h3><p>The most distinctive element of computer worm malware is that it’s the only type that can <a href=\"https://www.csoonline.com/article/3429569/what-is-a-computer-worm-how-this-self-spreading-malware-wreaks-havoc.html\">reproduce and copy itself on its own</a>. Worms will find the darkest recesses of a computer’s system and exploit existing vulnerabilities and backdoors. Often, worms use areas of an operating system that are invisible to users or that automatically run, which is why worms can spread quickly and thoroughly throughout a computer’s network.         </p><h3 id=\"ransomware\"><strong>Ransomware</strong></h3><p>Australian businesses have become a particular target for ransomware attacks. According to <a href=\"https://www.crowdstrike.com/resources/reports/global-attitude-survey-2020/\">one cyber security survey</a>, Australian businesses are being targeted at a 10 percent higher rate than the global average and have become the second most targeted country in the world. </p><p><strong>(<a href=\"https://www.superloop.com/blog/ransomware-explained-why-australian-businesses-target/\">Read more about the impact of ransomware on Australian businesses</a>)</strong></p><p>A ransomware attack happen when malware enters a system and locks or encrypts the user’s data, essentially holding the victim’s data hostage until the ransom is paid. </p><h3 id=\"cryptomining\"><strong>Cryptomining</strong></h3><p>Cryptocurrency mining (cryptomining) is a process whereby cryptocurrency transactions are verified using complex algorithms that require the processing power of computers to execute. In exchange for completing these complex problems, miners receive a small cryptocurrency fee. </p><p><a href=\"https://www.cyber.gov.au/acsc/view-all-content/threats/cryptomining#:~:text=To%20earn%20more%2C%20cybercriminals%20use,and%20stop%20them%20working%20normally\">Cryptomining itself is a legitimate process</a>, but becomes illegal when miners hack into a computer and leech off its computing power without the owner’s permission (sometimes also called <a href=\"https://www.avg.com/en/signal/bitcoin-miner-malware\">cryptojacking</a>). Cryptomining malware may not damage the hacked system, but its presence can drain a system’s resources, dramatically slow down processes, and even stop the network from working entirely. </p><p>According to the 2020 Deep Instincts Threat Report, malicious cryptomining activity saw an increase of 1061% last year, the highest increase of any form of malware attack of the year.  </p><h3 id=\"spyware\"><strong>Spyware</strong></h3><p>Spyware allows another individual to spy on the activities of its victim. Parents may install one form of spyware on their children's phones or computers to check where they are or what they’re doing online. Hackers, on the other hand, may use spyware to track a victim’s keystrokes to find out sensitive information like passwords that they can then use to infiltrate an individual’s computer. </p><p>Spyware, much like adware, has decreased in popularity in recent years, but can still pose a threat to businesses with limited cyber security protections in place. </p><h3 id=\"adware\"><strong>Adware</strong></h3><p>Generally speaking, adware, and its cousin spyware, are less dangerous than other forms of malware. However, the methods they use are often similar to the more negative malware attacks, which still makes them problematic to an organisation’s system and a user’s experience. </p><p>Adware will display ads on a computer or change search results so that the creators of the adware can make money from clicks, and many forms of adware don’t ask for consent before they’re installed. </p><p>As noted earlier, <a href=\"https://resources.malwarebytes.com/files/2019/01/Malwarebytes-Labs-2019-State-of-Malware-Report-2.pdf\">instances of adware have been declining</a> in recent years, perhaps because general cyber security practices make it easy to detect and eradicate.  </p><h3 id=\"malvertising\"><strong>Malvertising</strong></h3><p>Malvertising works quite differently to adware in that it uses a legitimate ad to deliver malware to anyone who clicks on it. In some cases, malicious actors may place an ad on a legitimate site that, when clicked, will either install malware directly on the computer or redirect the click-er to a malicious site. In other cases, hackers will compromise legitimate ad networks and replace legitimate ads with malicious ones. </p><p>The main threat of malvertising is that it can introduce other forms of malware, such as ransomware or Trojans into a computer or network.</p><h3 id=\"hybrids\"><strong>Hybrids</strong></h3><p>These days, it’s less common to see any of these malware types in their purest form. Instead, most consist of varying combinations of the different forms of malware. Modern malware will often take on aspects of Trojans, worms, and even viruses, or they may take the appearance of one form of malware but attack like another. </p><p>Using a combination of attacks makes a hacker’s target more vulnerable and the impact even more devastating. This is because many off-the-shelf cyber security programs are developed for specific types of malware rather than the amalgamations of malware forms that are prevalent today.   </p><h2 id=\"how-to-protect-your-business-against-malware-attacks\"><strong>How to protect your business against malware attacks</strong></h2><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://news.superloop.com/content/images/2021/06/image-7.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\"><figcaption>Cyber security best practices are a good place to start for protecting your network, but should not be considered the last line of defence.</figcaption></figure><p>In reality, your off-the-shelf antivirus software isn't going to cut it when you're up against the kind of sophisticated cyber attack events hitting Australian businesses today.  </p><p>According to the <a href=\"https://www.cyber.gov.au/acsc/view-all-content/threats/malware\">Australian Cyber Security Centre</a> (ACSC), there are a few ways you can protect your business against malware attacks, including:</p><ul><li>Frequently updating software</li><li>Using strong passwords (<a href=\"https://superloop.com/blog/guide-to-better-password-practices/\">read more about password best practices</a>)</li><li>Regularly backup files (ideally daily)</li><li>Disable Microsoft Office macros (<a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/enable-or-disable-macros-in-office-files-12b036fd-d140-4e74-b45e-16fed1a7e5c6\">here’s how to do it</a>)   </li><li>Uninstall unused programs and software</li><li>Keep employees informed of cyber security threats and best practices<br></li></ul><p>These steps are a good start, but are just a simple baseline for company-wide best practices.

    "title": "Beyond cost savings: 3 lesser known benefits moving to the cloud",
    "html": "<p><strong>The adages, “turn CapEx into OpEx” and “don’t focus on IT, focus on your core business” are what tend to motivate organisations to adopt a cloud model, but the real benefits of cloud extend far beyond this.</strong><br></p><p>This was evident in a<a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/joemckendrick/2015/03/09/one-in-four-enterprises-see-surprise-cloud-benefits-survey-finds/#d8e4e8c3a6c4\"> Tata Communications study</a>, which asked 1,000 executives about the benefits they’re experiencing in the cloud. While the usual contenders made an appearance – cost savings, improved security, faster access to data – more surprising was the 83% of executives who reported benefits they hadn’t expected. These included better communications within their organisations (25%), improved customer satisfaction (22%), and increased revenues they did not anticipate (22%).</p><p>Let’s explore these three lesser known benefits of moving to the cloud.</p><h3 id=\"1-the-cloud-s-impact-on-internal-communications\"><strong>1. The cloud’s impact on internal communications</strong></h3><p>The workforce is becoming more mobile and geographically dispersed. But being physically distant doesn’t mean communication has to suffer internally. In fact, many organisations are noticing that the cloud facilitates collaboration by <strong>bringing together employees</strong> and contractors from multiple locations, and enabling company data to be accessed from anywhere, on any device.</p><p>With the right cloud-based mobility and collaboration technologies in place, such as videoconferencing and file sharing, information can be more easily shared among team members, regardless of location, which supports teamwork and the generation of ideas.</p><p>Another way organisations are seeing improved communications with the cloud is via the phone system. Cloud IPBX allows workers to make, receive, and transfer business calls seamlessly, regardless of their location, meaning a user could be just as connected working in the office as he or she is on the road, or in a hotel room abroad.</p><p>But it’s not just about transcending physical boundaries. The main impact the cloud has on internal communications is breaking down ‘virtual’ boundaries in the form of data silos. Legacy infrastructure creates barriers between business functions where they otherwise might not have existed. If one department’s software doesn’t talk to another’s, it’s hard for them to work together.</p><p>Now, cloud-based Software as a Service platforms exist that integrate with other services, reducing these communication barriers inherent in so many organisations, and establishing cross-functional collaboration.</p><h3 id=\"2-the-cloud-s-impact-on-customer-satisfaction\"><strong>2. The cloud’s impact on customer satisfaction</strong></h3><p>For many organisations, the cloud is turning out to be the <strong>secret weapon</strong> to relieve common service complaints and delight customers.</p><p>Today’s tech-savvy consumers are high maintenance; they want immediate, tailored solutions, wherever they are, and on their platform of choice. The role of IT infrastructure is to facilitate the exchange of information across the organisation, but as we explained, legacy systems force data to remain in silos.</p><p>A cloud infrastructure, on the other hand, democratises data and ensures the right people, processes, and systems talk to each other, at the right time. From a digital standpoint, delivering a superior customer experience is only going to be possible if an organisation’s own internal experience is seamless.</p><p>But <strong>it’s not just digital touchpoints</strong> – moving to the cloud can also improve the physical touchpoints (A <em>touchpoint</em> can be defined as any way a <em>consumer</em> can interact with a <em>business)</em> customers have with the company. When the internal IT experience is better, employees are happier, and this happiness extends to the customer.</p><h3 id=\"3-the-cloud-s-impact-on-revenue\"><strong>3. The cloud’s impact on revenue</strong></h3><p>While most organisations go into the cloud expecting to save money, many are finding that they’re actually <em>making</em> money with the cloud.</p><p>This is because the customer experience is fast becoming the key to achieving a competitive advantage. In fact, a 2016 study by customer intelligence consulting firm, Walker, found that customer experience will overtake price and product as the key brand differentiator by 2020.</p><p>A huge finding from this study was that <strong>86% of consumers are prepared to pay more for better customer experience.</strong> It’s clear, then, why so many businesses who have adopted the cloud are seeing surprise revenue growth. Delivering an effortless digital experience will improve customer loyalty and see sales soar for organisations that get it right, boosting their bottom line as a result.</p><h3 id=\"more-to-cloud-than-meets-the-eye\"><strong>More to cloud than meets the eye</strong></h3><p>There is much more to cloud computing than technology alone, and <strong>its benefits extend far beyond cost savings</strong>. While the initial focus might be on cost justification, there’s a growing recognition of the role that the cloud can play in supporting employee morale, customer satisfaction, and revenue growth.</p>",
